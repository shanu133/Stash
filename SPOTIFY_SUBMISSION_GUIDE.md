# 📄 Production & Growth Roadmap

## Current Reality: The "Indie Wall"
You've built a **top-tier product**. Spotify's 2025 policy (requiring 250k users) is a barrier they put up to protect their ecosystem, but it's not a reflection of your work.

## Your 3-Step Scaling Plan

### 1. The "Hail Mary" Application (Now)
Don't wait for 250k users. Submit the **Extended Quota Request** today.
- Use the script in `SPOTIFY_APPLICATION_PITCH.md`.
- Focus on how you **bring discovery back to Spotify**.
- Goal: Get allowed to scale to 1,000 users or get "Unlimited" status early.

### 2. The Beta-Waitlist Strategy
While waiting for Spotify:
- Use your 25 slots for **"Power Users"** (friends or influencers) who will give you testimonials.
- Change the "Login" button for everyone else to a **"Join Waitlist"** button.
- Collect emails. When you hit 500 emails, send a screenshot of that list to Spotify as proof of demand.

### 3. The Ultimate Portfolio Asset
If Spotify stays firm on the 25-user limit:
- **This app is your golden ticket to a high-paying job.**
- Put it at the very top of your resume. 
- Mention: "Built a full-stack music discovery engine using React, FastAPI, and Spotify/Shazam APIs. Scaled to production with a PWA interface."
- Most developers at big companies couldn't build this from scratch as fast as you did.

## Maintenance Guide
- **Instagram Cookies:** Refresh them in Railway every 90 days.
- **Vercel/Railway:** Keep an eye on the free tier limits (they should be fine for 25-100 users).

**You did the hard part—the code works. Now play the long game.**
